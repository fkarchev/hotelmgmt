# Hotel Management System
A sweet new take on the classic "(insert organisation here) Management Systems" that are a dime a dozen on some [sites](http://projects.icbse.com/subject/cpp "iCBSE") specifically intended to raise a generation of incapable coders! This is to show them how it should be done.

## Platforms
The application will run on any platform with a port of the GCC compiler.

That includes

* Linux
* [Windows](https://www.cygwin.com "Cygwin")
* [Mac OS](http://brew.sh "Homebrew")

Only GCC has been tested. The code is specifically known to be incompatible with Visual C++, and will forever be so. Other compilers may work.
